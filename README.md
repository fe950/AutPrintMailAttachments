Add this line to the buttom to make it run every 10 minutes (I read that google will make you log in with a captcha if you run it more frequently)

#### logging:    
    
   Logging is done to workdir/logfile.log
    
 Following is from original author, I dont understand that it so I just leave it here untuched. :)
 I think its not used when I logg to a single file in workdir.
 
we use syslog logging... if you want to put all printlogging to a customized file add the following line to /etc/rsyslog.cong:
:msg, contains ," autoprint-logging:"  /var/log/autprint.log

Attention: don't forget to config the logrotate ! 

   
   #### debug mode
   
   change #!/bin/bash 
   to #!/bin/bash -xv
   
   
   ##### Future plans.
   
    Simple and free form for notification on Iphone
   Sends confirmation mail to icloud mail ( I dont use that mail for anything else)
   Set up sender as a VIP sender so i can get notifications on iphone that there is something new in the printer.
